# Escape-the-Titanic

Oregon State University CS 162 Final Project that simulates escaping from the Titanic. 


Explore rooms to find items that can help you escape before the Titanic floods!


This was a fairly straightforward project. The most helpful assignments were the ones that dealt with linked lists and polymorphism. I felt like I was able to map out and execute a plan very easily for this project as compared to past projects. I think the fact that we were allowed to use our knowledge in such a free-flowing way gave me a lot of confidence in my abilities and allowed me to put together a program I completely understood every aspect of. I did find that I still have some issues with linked lists and how to best develop structures for queues. This project also forced me to go back and review polymorphism and abstract classes, which solidified my understanding of how they communicate with base classes. Once again I had some trouble with memory leaks, but they were much easier to deal with in a static linked list environment. I also had some difficulty implementing the counter. I wanted every decision the user made to contribute to the counter, so that if the user spends a lot of time making incorrect choices, they would die. I ended up implementing the counter as a while loop that chose the menu based on what the current room is. Overall, I had a lot of fun with this project. I enjoyed the autonomy given and appreciated that the scope did not involve anything we hadnâ€™t already covered.
